## 🎬 What is HIST-C?

HIST-C is a powerful web-based tool that compresses entire codebases into optimized, LLM-friendly formats. Perfect for when you need to share your project with AI assistants, conduct code reviews, or create compact documentation.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔥 Aggressive Compression**: Achieve 40-70% size reduction while maintaining code integrity
- **🧠 LLM-Optimized**: Output specifically formatted for AI model consumption
- **🌐 Universal Language Support**: Works with 15+ programming languages
- **📁 Smart File Filtering**: Automatically excludes bloat (node_modules, .git, etc.)
- **🎯 Zero Setup**: Pure client-side processing, no servers required
- **📊 Detailed Analytics**: See exactly what was compressed and by how much

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open HIST-C**: Simply open the `index.html` file (or `hist-c.html` file, if downloading as a release) in any modern browser
2. **Drop Your Project**: Drag and drop your project folder onto the upload area
3. **Configure Settings**: Choose your compression level and filtering options
4. **Shrink Away**: Click "Shrink My Codebase" and watch the magic happen!
5. **Export**: Copy or download your compressed codebase

## 🛠️ Compression Features

### 🧹 Code Cleaning
- ✅ Remove all comments (supports 15+ languages)
- ✅ Eliminate empty lines and excess whitespace
- ✅ Strip debug logs and console statements
- ✅ Basic code minification

### 📂 Smart Filtering
- ✅ Pre-configured exclusion patterns (node_modules, .git, dist, build)
- ✅ Customizable include/exclude rules
- ✅ Extension-based filtering
- ✅ Automatic binary file detection

### 📊 Output Optimization
- ✅ File tree generation for context
- ✅ Compression statistics and analytics
- ✅ Clear file separators for LLM parsing
- ✅ Optional text compression for maximum efficiency

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **🤖 LLM Code Analysis**: Feed your entire codebase to ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI assistants
- **👥 Code Reviews**: Share compressed codebases with team members
- **📚 Documentation**: Create compact project overviews
- **🔍 Debugging**: Get AI help with complex, multi-file issues
- **📝 Technical Writing**: Include entire codebases in documentation

## 📈 Compression Results

### Typical Compression Ratios:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: 45-65% reduction
- **Python**: 40-60% reduction  
- **Java/C#**: 50-70% reduction
- **HTML/CSS**: 35-55% reduction
- **Mixed Projects**: 40-60% reduction

### Example Results:
```
📊 Real Project Examples:
• Next.js App (143 files): 480KB → 397KB (17.3% reduction)
• Python API (67 files): 245KB → 142KB (42.0% reduction) 
• React Component Library (89 files): 156KB → 89KB (43.0% reduction)
```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
1. Open HIST-C in your browser
2. Drag your project folder to the upload area
3. Click "Shrink My Codebase"
4. Copy the output for use with your LLM

### Advanced Configuration
- **Include Extensions**: `js,ts,py,java,cpp,html,css,vue,go,rs`
- **Exclude Patterns**: `node_modules,dist,build,*.min.js,coverage`
- **Compression Level**: Choose from basic cleaning to aggressive minification
- **Output Format**: File tree + separated files or continuous stream

### LLM Integration Tips
```
🎯 Pro Tips for LLM Usage:
• Include the file tree for better context understanding
• Use file separators to help AI navigate your code
• Enable compression stats to show AI the scope
• Focus on source code files only for better token efficiency
```
